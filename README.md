1. How to compile?
   make
2. How to run?
   ./project1


Please change the input for problem1(int n) in main to test matrix with different size.
problem1() will generate a random matrix.

Print out will verify U is orthogonal, and B is inverse of A

Please contact 765-436-5717 if there are something wrong during testing.

Thanks
